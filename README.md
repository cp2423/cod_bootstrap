# cod_bootstrap

Attempt to use service numbers as starting point to "bootstrap" an OCR model to read the whole document.


## Plan

Initial steps:

* enchange image; and/or
* work out how to find the service number in the doc first, then enchance
* do the rest (tbc)


## Enhancement techniques

TODO


## Random stuff I found at the start

https://github.com/idea-fasoc/datasheet-scrubber - the datasheet scrubber project which started this iteration. Also https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590005622000595 which I think put me on to it.

https://github.com/ROBINADC/Neural-Enhanced-Live-Streaming - A real-time streaming framework that utilizes neural network-based super-resolution to enhance live video quality
