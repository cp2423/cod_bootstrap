# Initialisation Scripts

Perform one of tasks like setting up database, extracting sources downloaded as tar files, etc.

Example execution beacuse Python packaging/paths are all a bit funky:

```
python3 -m scripts.make_baclac_index
```

Note:
- run from cod_bootstrap root directory
- dot not slash in the middle
- no .py at the end
